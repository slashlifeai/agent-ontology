# Project Roadmap: Semantic Agent Ontology

**Status:** Draft
**Version:** 0.1

## 1. Vision

To establish the Semantic Agent Ontology as a foundational W3C standard for interoperable, accountable, and trustworthy AI agent communication, enabling a new generation of collaborative AI ecosystems.

## 2. Key Milestones & Phases

Our roadmap is structured around the W3C standardization process, with a strong emphasis on community engagement and technical refinement.

### Phase 1: Community Group Incubation (Current - Q1 2026)

**Objective:** Build a vibrant community, gather initial feedback, and refine the core ontology based on diverse use cases and technical input.

*   **Milestones:**
    *   **W3C Community Group Established:** Successful activation of the W3C Semantic Agent Communication Community Group.
    *   **Initial Community Engagement:** Active participation in discussions, regular meetings, and initial contributions from diverse stakeholders.
    *   **Core Ontology Refinement (v0.2):** Incorporate feedback from the community to enhance clarity, completeness, and practical applicability of `core.ttl` and related modules.
    *   **Expanded Use Cases & Examples:** Develop a richer set of real-world examples in `ontologies/examples/` to demonstrate the ontology's utility.
    *   **Automated Validation (CI):** Implement and stabilize automated SHACL validation for all ontology modules (completed).

### Phase 2: Towards First Public Working Draft (Q2 - Q3 2026)

**Objective:** Transition the work from the Community Group to a W3C Working Group, aiming for the publication of the First Public Working Draft (FPWD).

*   **Milestones:**
    *   **W3C Working Group Proposal:** Submit a formal proposal to establish a W3C Working Group for the Semantic Agent Ontology.
    *   **Working Group Formation:** Successful chartering and launch of the W3C Working Group.
    *   **First Public Working Draft (FPWD):** Publish the initial version of the Semantic Agent Ontology specification as a W3C FPWD.
    *   **Test Suite Development (Initial):** Begin developing a comprehensive test suite to ensure interoperability and conformance.

### Phase 3: Candidate Recommendation & Beyond (Q4 2026 onwards)

**Objective:** Advance the specification through the W3C Recommendation Track, ensuring broad implementation and adoption.

*   **Milestones:**
    *   **Candidate Recommendation (CR):** Achieve Candidate Recommendation status, indicating a stable specification ready for implementation experience.
    *   **Implementation Report:** Gather and document multiple independent implementations of the ontology.
    *   **Proposed Recommendation (PR):** Advance to Proposed Recommendation status.
    *   **W3C Recommendation (REC):** Publish the Semantic Agent Ontology as a full W3C Recommendation.
    *   **ISO/IEC Liaison & Alignment:** Continue to foster alignment and potential downstream standardization with ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 42.

## 3. Contribution Areas

We welcome contributions across all phases, particularly in:

*   **Technical Specification:** Refining ontology definitions, properties, and constraints.
*   **Use Case Development:** Providing real-world scenarios and examples.
*   **Tooling & Implementations:** Developing parsers, validators, and reference implementations.
*   **Documentation:** Improving clarity, completeness, and accessibility of all project documents.
*   **Community Building:** Participating in discussions, outreach, and event organization.

This roadmap is a living document and will be updated based on community feedback and W3C process requirements.
