Title: Scope Alignment Note – Agent Governance Community Group
Status: Draft
Last Updated: 2025-11-12

1. Purpose

This note defines the boundaries between the areas governed by the W3C and those coordinated with external infrastructure partners. It ensures that the Community Group’s work remains within the W3C’s process scope while maintaining interoperability with broader computing and attestation ecosystems.

2. In-Scope for W3C

The Community Group focuses on the layers that are directly relevant to W3C standardization:
  * Semantic interoperability and ontology definition for agent behavior.
  * Identity, delegation, and traceability schema (aligned with DID/VC standards).
  * API-level and data-exchange specifications using JSON-LD, RDF, and OpenAPI bindings.
  * Governance and compliance models for inter-agent communication.

3. Out-of-Scope (Handled via External Partners)

The following domains are beyond W3C’s direct governance but will be aligned through technical and institutional collaboration:
  * Hardware attestation and trusted execution: coordinated with hardware security providers.
  * Runtime security and cloud orchestration: aligned with major cloud service frameworks.
  * AI compute and model execution infrastructure: coordinated with leading compute infrastructure partners.
  * Edge transport and network security: aligned with global content delivery networks.

4. Coordination Objectives

The group’s goal is to maintain semantic and protocol interoperability across these layers.
While W3C governs the semantic and identity interfaces, hardware and runtime trust mechanisms remain under the responsibility of external partners. The CG will produce ontology mappings and reference schemas to bridge these domains.
