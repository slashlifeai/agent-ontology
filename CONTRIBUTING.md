# How to Contribute

We welcome contributions from all members of the community! This document outlines how you can participate and help improve the Semantic Agent Ontology. Our primary goal right now is to gather feedback and build a strong community around our [W3C Community Group Proposal](https://www.w3.org/community/groups/proposal/...).

## Getting Started

The best way to join the effort is to get involved in the conversation.

1.  **Join the W3C Community Group:** This is the central hub for all discussions. [**Click here to join and participate.**](https://www.w3.org/community/groups/proposal/...)

3.  **Review our proposal:** Read our [W3C Community Group proposal](https://www.w3.org/community/groups/proposal/...) and see the vision we've laid out.

## How to Provide Feedback

Your feedback on the proposal is critical at this stage. You can:

*   **Use GitHub Issues:** Open an issue to provide feedback, ask questions, or suggest changes related to the proposal. Please tag it with the `w3c-proposal` label.
