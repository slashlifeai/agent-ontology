# Agent Ontology — W3C Community Group Work Repository

This repository hosts the ontology and semantic modeling work of the  
**W3C Semantic Agent Communication Community Group**.

The work focuses on defining the semantic structures required for  
communication between AI agents operating as delegated and accountable  
technical principals.

## Scope

The repository includes:

- Ontologies describing agent identity, capability, intent semantics,
  delegation structures, and verifiable accountability chains.
- JSON-LD schemas for interoperable agent-to-agent data exchange.
- Examples illustrating how the ontologies may be used across
  heterogeneous runtimes and OS-level environments.
- Supporting materials for Community Group discussions and participation.

## Related Foundations
